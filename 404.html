    <p>This site is static ajax-application which works under main <strong>index.html</strong> file, so don't try to go around looking for other pages, it's useless.</p>
    <p>If you want to go to specific page, use <a href="https://ewancoder.github.io/?2">https://ewancoder.github.io/?2</a> link. Note question mark before number - it means that you are not going to another page, you're just passing a variable to a javascript engine.</p>
    <p>If you want to go to main page, but scroll down to specific page, use <a href="https://ewancoder.github.io/?p2">https://ewancoder.github.io/?p2</a> link. Note the "p" sign before the number. It stays for "place on main page" and not this page itself. Question mark here is required too.</p>
